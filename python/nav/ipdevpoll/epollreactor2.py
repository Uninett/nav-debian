"""Custom epollreactor implementation for ipdevpoll.

part that seems incompatible with pynetsnmp, which is central to ipdevpoll.

        Private method for removing a descriptor from the event loop.

        It does the inverse job of _add, and also add a check in case of the fd
        has gone away.

        It overrides the inherited epollreactor functionality to ensure that file
        descriptors closed behind our back are ignored and properly removed from the
        reactor's internal data structures. This is needed mostly because pynetsnmp
        adds reactor readers for file descriptors that are managed by the NET-SNMP C
        library. There is no way for Python code close these file descriptors in a
        controlled way, wherein they are removed from the reactor first - the
        NET-SNMP library will close them "behind our backs", so to speak.

        Attempting to unregister a closed file descriptor from the epoll object will
        cause an OSError that the original implementation left the client to handle -
        but this also caused the internal data structures of the reactor to become
        inconsistent.
