<h2>Audit logging</h2>

<p>
  To ensure traceability of user initiated changes to the NAV database,
  some user actions are logged. This log is only available to the NAV
  administrators for your local installation.
</p>

<p>
  Typical examples are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a user logs in</li>
  <li>updating IP Device configuration in SeedDB</li>
  <li>updating an interface in PortAdmin</li>
</ul>
