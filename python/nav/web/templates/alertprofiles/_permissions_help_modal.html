  Set which filter groups the different user groups are allowed
  to receive alerts for.

<p>
  Denying a user group to receive alerts from a certain filter group will
  not hide that filter group from the interface, so the users of that
  user group can still add the filter group to their profiles. They
  still won't receive any alerts that matches that filter group though.
