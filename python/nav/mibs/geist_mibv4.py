"""
A class that tries to retrieve all internal sensors from Geist-branded WeatherGoose
products.

Uses the vendor-specific GEIST-V4-MIB (derived from the IT-WATCHDOGS-V4-MIB)
to detect and collect sensor-information.

Please note:
This is NOT a full implementaion of the GEIST-V4-MIB. Only the internal
sensors of the box are implemented. The box can be extended with additional
external sensors, but these are not implemented because we did not have any
external sensors available at the time of this implementation.
